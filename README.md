 # ServoAnsteuerung

...is a Windows program for setting the operating parameters for the servo controls ([Servo](https://www.github.com/Kruemelbahn/Servo) or [Servo2](https://www.github.com/Kruemelbahn/Servo2)).
The program is only necessary if your servocontrol does not function satisfactorily with the default settings.
The program is compiled for x64-mode and works under Windows 10 or 11 and may work also on previous Windows-Versions (without guarantee). A version for Windows-32 is also available.<br>

The program was created to the best of our knowledge and without guarantee of function in the hope that it will be useful.
If it is not useful - then it is not.

### Hint
If the program "Servoansteuerung.exe" cannot be started because MFC140.DLL is missing,
please use 'vc_redist.x64.exe' (this is an installer for MFC140.DLL) which can be downloaded from here (original link to Microsoft page):

https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe 

Execute the downloaded file for install.
